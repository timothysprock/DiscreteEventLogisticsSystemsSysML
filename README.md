Contact me to gain access to the new project

## Overview
A discrete event logistics system (or DELS) can be described as:

•	a network of resources, arranged in a facility; each resource has one or more processing capabilities and for each capability, it has a capacity; 

•	a set of products flow through this network of resources, and are transformed by processes executed by the resources; a process may require the capabilities of more than one resource; the transformation can change location, age, or condition

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop abstractions and methodologies to integrate systems models with analysis models and tools, such as discrete event simulation.
